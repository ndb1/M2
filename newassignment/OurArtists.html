<br>
<p><img src="images/Aquapella01.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<p>Aquapella are 50 singers from the Townsville area bringing you a cappella world music at its very best: inspiring and uplifting harmonies from around the globe. A South African party song, a Hungarian love triangle, "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" in French - a sumptuous variety of different languages, stories, rhythms and moods to entertain and move you in the wonderful common language of music. Come along and travel the world by song!</p>
<p>Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating in classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C minor etc. A study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh Male Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology he concentrated on his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for several years. In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics and involved himself in choir music again. For 12 years he conducted AkaBella, a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated in major festivals like the National Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC documentary.Festival on Fire and launched their first CD 'Mosaic'. Beat moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful world music choir for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs focus on the rich musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A South African party song, a Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety and depth of a cappella world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a very enriching and uplifting experience.</p>

<p>Aquapella won the ABC Choir of the Year competition for Queensland in 2006.

<p>The alternative celtic rock band from North Queensland</p>
<p>Typical audience response: - "WOW - I wasn't prepared for that! Racing around the stage in kilts, blowing bagpipes, jumping from one instrument to the next, these guys know how to entertain!"</p>
<p>They will break your heart with the mournful and eerie sounds of the Great Highland Bagpipe and then crank it up real hard and rock you 'til you drop.</p>

<p><img src="images/Poms.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<p>Poms from Oz are Judy, Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland, Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First Fleeters.</p>
<p>Their tight harmony and vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar and/or harmonica. Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive, as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices.</p>
<p>A tast brew of Oz songs and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red , sit back and enjoy. For further information or bookings contact the Music Centre 4724 2086<br />or email <p> <a href=

<h2 id="Camerata">Camerata</h2>
<p><img src="images/Camerata.jpg" width="500" height="300">
<p>The concept of the Camerata Singers originated in the 1980s when Susan Grinsell, who was teaching voice at James Cook University realised that ensemble singing was sadly lacking for tertiary music students. Since then, Susan, along with repetiteur Carol DalOsto, has strived to bring quality ensemble singing to the wider community by performing at events from the Ingham Italian Festival through to Cotters Markets in the mall.</p>
<p>The Camerata Singers comprises a group of trained singers, both male and female, from age 18 and over who strive to provide quality performances in a range of styles from classical through to A cappella and contemporary. A number of members also regularly participate in local music theatre and theatre productions.
